Speak Agent coding challenge for backend developers


Set up your local environment
-----------------------------

Go to the Github repo and create a fork of the repository. Using virtualenv, install the Django project onto your local machine. Set up the database and add some data.

Make some modifications
-----------------------

The student model under the Student app is fairly barebones. Add the following fields:

- Date of birth
- Grade

Add a view
----------

Create a new view for getting all students in the database of the same grade. Add a new route and a template to display the data from this view. It should look something like this:

***

All students
============

- Abner, Jill - Grade K, born 6/2/2011
- Bela, Juan - Grade 1, born 2/2/201
...

***

Add new models
--------------

In the Student app, add two new models: School and Teacher. The fields for each:

School:
  Title, address

Teacher:
  First name, last name

Hook up the new models to Student
---------------------------------

Each student has one school, but can have multiple teachers. Add these fields to the student model and migrate the database.

Add in Django Rest Framework
----------------------------

Our work at Speak Agent relies heavily on the Django Rest Framework. It’s okay if you’re not familiar with it, but being able to read the documentation and set up a simple call will show us that you can quickly get up to speed with our architecture.

Here is the link to the Django Rest Framework documentation: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/. It may be helpful to also go through the DRF tutorial: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#tutorial.

Now that the app is set up, create two API calls:
- One for getting one student by PK
- One for getting all students in the system

The JSON returned from the calls should look something like this:

Single student:

    {
        first_name: first_name,
        last_name: last_name,
        grade: grade,
        dob: date
    }

All students:

    {
        [
            first_name: first_name,
            last_name: last_name,
            grade: grade,
            dob: date
        ],
        ...
    }

***

Make sure that these calls work before moving onto the next section.

Deploy to Heroku
----------------

> Heroku is another important part of our architecture. Once again, it’s okay if you’re not familiar with it, but being able deploy a site to Heroku will show us that you can quickly get up to speed with our architecture.

> Here is a link to the Heroku documentation about getting a Django site set up on their dynos: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python

Now that the app is complete, you’ll need to deploy it to Heroku. Note: Please use the free tier!

Deploy the app to Heroku, create some data, and create an admin login for a member of the Speak Agent team to use.

Submit the app to Speak Agent
-----------------------------

Create a pull request on the Speak Agent repo and email Speak Agent a link to your Heroku site, including the admin username and password that you created. We’ll contact you within a few days!
